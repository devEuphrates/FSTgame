# Five Stars Tycoon: _A Hotel Management Game_

A management game where you build your dream hotel and try to keep your customers happy and well fed.

## How Am I Making It?
I am a single dev and I am doing everything by myself. I mostly use open source software and try to keep the  
cost at minimum. I try not to out-source anything but because of time issues I take some assets(royalty free)  
from the internet.  

### Programs I Am Using
* Engine: [Unity][unity]
* 3D: [Blender][blender]
* 2D: [GIMP][gimp]

## Main Mechanics
The game is all about giving players every tool they need to create their own building and ecosystems and making them manage their  
resources carefuly while making sure their customers are happy and staff is paid. Players must make sure that their customers are  
happy when they are leaving because they can leave reviews about your hotel and these reviews will effect your buisness depending on  
that customers social presence.

## What Makes This Game Different From Other Management Games  
In core this game is not too much different from other buisness-management type games but the freedom it gives to players while building  
and pushing them into making different decisions depending on the situation to keep their customers happy will keep the game fun and replayable.
